# Codius-config-files
Just a collection of my (working) configs for my Codius host running v1.2.5

## General
My host is built on CentOS 7.5 and use default paths and commands for that system. Have that in mind if something is different on your system.

## Urls

## Installation
I always recommend this excellent script for installing and maintaining a Codius host: https://github.com/xrp-community/codius-install
My hosts are based on this and works perfectly.
