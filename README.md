# Codius-config-files
Just a collection of my (working) configs for my Codius host running v1.2.5

My hosts are CentOS 7.5 and use default paths and commands for that system. Have that in mind if something is different on your system.

# Installation
I always recommend this excellent script for installing and maintaining a Codius host: https://github.com/xrp-community/codius-install
My hosts are based on this and works perfectly.
